# The Closet

Been on a bit of a (non-coding) tangent today...
Decided to *document* it for posterity.

What would ***you*** do with a **200 cm long** x
**85 cm wide** x **223 cm tall** closet in **London**?

## What?

London is in the top 20 most expensive cities in the world to live in (and visit).



## Initial Research

### Capsule Hotel

A capsule hotel (カプセルホテル ***kapuseru hoteru***) is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of ***extremely small*** "rooms" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels.

### Pod Hotel (Singapore)

Since living in a hostel in 2007 I've been keen on the idea of minimalist sleeping while still having privacy.
This is a picture of a "Pod" Hotel in Singapore.

### AirBnB London (Cheapest)

You may need to edit this search depending on when you click the link: https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/London?checkin=01-10-2015&checkout=02-10-2015&price_max=20&ss_id=198vb2a9

At the time of writing a *sofa bed* in
London is going for £20 per night.

Whereas a bunk bed in a ***shared room***
would set you back "*just*"

### Back of the Envelope Calculation

if we can get 40% occupancy at £15 per night
+ £15 x 365 x 40% = £2,190 (per year Gross)

AirBnB would take their cut and we would have
to clean the room (change sheets etc)

# The Closet

What would ***you*** do with a **200 cm long** x
**83 cm wide** x **223 cm tall** closet in **London**?

Here's a to-scale sketchup base showing the dimensions of **The Closet** with human for reference; *not* a lot of space...

# Library

My *initial* idea for the space was to use it as storage for our (*extensive*) collection
of Technology + Business (& other interesting) books.
e.g:

But I soon realised I was missing an opportunity!

## What if the Closet Could be a Spare Room?!

Since living in a hostel in 2007 I've been thinking about the idea of minimalist sleeping quarters (while still having privacy ... most hostels are shared dormes)

## Research

So I did a bit of googling...

### Capsule Hotel

A capsule hotel (カプセルホテル ***kapuseru hoteru***) is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features a large number of ***extremely small*** "rooms" (capsules) intended to provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require the services offered by more conventional hotels.

### Could the Project Pay for its' Self?

While at *first* I thought a single bed in the closet would be good for a visiting (solo) friend/relative (though only the kind who does not mind a camping-matrress-width sleeping space) it got me wondering if,
I could *re-coup* the investment I'm going to have to spend to transform ***The Closet*** into a useable space.

### AirBnB London (Cheapest)

So I took to **AirBnB** to see what the cheapest beds in London are...

You may need to edit this search depending on when you click the link: https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/London?checkin=01-10-2015&checkout=02-10-2015&price_max=20&ss_id=198vb2a9

At the time of writing a *sofa bed* in
London is going for £20 per night.

Whereas a **bunk bed** in a ***shared room***
would set you back "*just*" ***£10 per night***:

Bearing in mind that **The Closet** would
be a self-contained (albeit *small*) *private* space which

#### Lighting

Given that **The Closet** is gets no natural light, I plan on brightening it up with som LEDs.

+ Perspex/Acrylic cut-to-order:

(I need to buy 6 x 5m ... how many 12V power converts should I get?)
Thanks!

### Back of the Envelope Calculation

if we can get 40% occupancy at **£17 per night**
+ £17 x 365 x 40% = £2,190 (per year Gross)

AirBnB would take their cut and we would have
to clean the room (change sheets etc)
but if we were able to turn around the room
in 20 mins at £10/h it would cost us
£4 per stay.
